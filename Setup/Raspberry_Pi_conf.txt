Steps for Raspberry Pi Configuration

To configure your Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

1.Open PuTTY and Enter Hostname:
    # Launch PuTTY.
    # Enter the hostname openhabian to connect to your Raspberry Pi.

2.Change the WiFi Settings:
    # In the terminal, edit the WiFi configuration file:

    Code:(sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf)

    # Add your WiFi SSID and password (preferably a 2.4GHz network):
    (
        network={
        ssid="Your_SSID"
        psk="Your_WiFi_Password"
        }
    )
    
3.Change the OpenHABian WiFi Settings:
    # Edit the OpenHABian configuration file:

    Code:(sudo nano /boot/openhabian.conf)

4.Reboot Raspberry Pi:
    # Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the new settings:

    Code:(sudo reboot)

5.Fetch the IP Address for MQTT Broker:
    # After rebooting, retrieve the IP address of the Raspberry Pi, 
    which will be used for the MQTT broker in OpenHABian binding and ESP32 code:
    Code:(hostname -I)

These steps will help you configure your Raspberry Pi with the necessary WiFi settings and retrieve the IP address for the MQTT broker.
