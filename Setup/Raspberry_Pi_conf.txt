Steps for Raspberry Pi Wifi & Static Ip Configuration

//To configure your Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

1.Open PuTTY and Enter Hostname:
    # Launch PuTTY.
    # Enter the hostname openhabian to connect to your Raspberry Pi.

2.Change the WiFi Settings:
    # In the terminal, edit the WiFi configuration file:
        "sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf"

    # Add your WiFi SSID and password (preferably a 2.4GHz network):
        "{
            network={
            ssid="Your_SSID"
            psk="Your_WiFi_Password"
            }
        }"
        
3.Change the OpenHABian WiFi Settings:
    # Edit the OpenHABian configuration file:
        "sudo nano /boot/openhabian.conf"

4.Reboot Raspberry Pi:
    # Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the new settings:
        "sudo reboot"

5.Fetch the IP Address for MQTT Broker:
    # After rebooting, retrieve the IP address of the Raspberry Pi, which will be used for the MQTT broker in OpenHABian binding and ESP32 code:
        "hostname -I"



//To configure a static IP address for your Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

1.Fetch the IP Address:
    # Obtain the current IP address of your Raspberry Pi:
        "hostname -I"

2.Fetch the Name Server:
    # Open the resolv.conf file to find the name server information:
        "sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf"

    # Note the IP address listed under nameserver.

3.Fetch the Router IP Address:
    # Obtain the IP address of your router:
        "ip r"

    # Note the IP address listed as default via.

4.Add the Details to dhcpcd.conf:
    # Open the dhcpcd.conf file to configure the static IP settings:
        "sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf"

    # Add the following configuration at the end of the file, replacing the placeholders with your actual network details:
        "{
            interface wlan0
            static ip_address=Your_Static_IP/24
            static routers=Your_Router_IP
            static domain_name_servers=Your_Nameserver_IP
        }"

    # Example configuration:
        {
            interface wlan0
            static ip_address=192.168.1.100/24
            static routers=192.168.1.1
            static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8
        }

5.Reboot the Raspberry Pi:
    # Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the new static IP settings:
        "sudo reboot"
